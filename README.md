# downscalr
An R package for downscaling of land-use and land-use change projections. You find the same information (and example [vignettes](https://tkrisztin.github.io/downscalr/articles/downscalr_tutorial.html)) on the [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) website [here](https://tkrisztin.github.io/downscalr/).

This package was developed in the context of the SPIPA Argentina project, in joint cooperation with colleagues from the [National Agricultural Technology Institute](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/inta). The main purpose of this was to port IIASA's [DownScale](https://github.com/iiasa/DownScale) model, for easier comparison with INTA's Argentina specific implementation of [Dinamica EGO](https://csr.ufmg.br/dinamica/) for the purpose of downscaling [FABLE Calculator](https://www.abstract-landscapes.com/fable-calculator) output. This enables a more in-depth representation of high-resolution land-use change projections.

Originally downscalr was developed to provide high-resolution projections of the [GLOBIOM](https://iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/GLOBIOM/GLOBIOM.html) model. However, within the course of SPIPA Argentina we have expanded it to be fully compatible with FABLE Calculator output. Moreover, the code was ported to R and documented thoroughly, to enable ease of use by INTA, our Argentinian project partner.

# Installation:

You need R to run the scripts. In R the following commands install the `devtools` and `downscalr` packages. Devtools is required to install packages from Github. 
For now, if you want to install the package with its vignette -- this provides a quick guide on how to use `downscalr` --, `knitr` and `rmarkdown` are required as well. 

      # just install the downscalr package
      ## install.packages("devtools")
      devtools::install_github("tkrisztin/downscalr", ref="HEAD", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
      
      # install the downscalr package with vignette 
      # (note: this may take a couple minutes since some computing is required to render the vignette). 
      ## install.packages(c("devtools", "knitr", "rmarkdown"))
      devtools::install_github("tkrisztin/downscalr", ref="HEAD", build_vignettes = TRUE, repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
      
# Running downscalr

If you have have followed the install instructions with vignette above, you can view a step by step tutorial via the following command in R: 

      browseVignettes("downscalr")

This should open a tab in your browser, click on "HTML" to access the tutorial. For additional guidance see the DownScale package documentation here: https://bit.ly/3fiLG3u

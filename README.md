# downscalr
A package for high-resolution simulation of land-use change projections, with support for downscaling. 

This package was developed in the context of the SPIPA Argentina project, in joint cooperation with colleagues from the [National Agricultural Technology Institute](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/inta). The main purpose of this package is to combine the IIASA's [DownScale](https://github.com/iiasa/DownScale) model, with INTA's Argentina specific implementation of the [Dinamica EGO](https://csr.ufmg.br/dinamica/) for the purpose of downscaling [FABLE Calculator](https://www.abstract-landscapes.com/fable-calculator) output. This will enable a more in-depth representation of high-resolution land-use change projections.

Originally DownScale was developed to provide high-resolution projections of the [GLOBIOM](https://iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/GLOBIOM/GLOBIOM.html) model. However, within the course of this project we have expanded it to be fully compatible with FABLE Calculator data. Moreover the code was ported to R and documented thoroughly, to enable ease of use by INTA, our Argentinian project partner.

# Installation:

You need R to run the scripts. In R the following commands install the devtools and downscalr packages. Devtools is required to install packages from Github.

      # install.packages("devtools")
      devtools::install_github("tkrisztin/downscalr", ref="HEAD", build_vignettes = TRUE)
      
# Running downscalr

For now you can view a step by step tutorial on how to run "downscalr' -- if you have have followed the install instructions above -- with the following command in R: 

      browseVignettes("downscalr")

This should open a tab in your browser, click on "HTML" to access the tutorial. For additional guidance see the DownScale package documentation here: https://bit.ly/3fiLG3u
